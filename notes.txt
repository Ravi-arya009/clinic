-to do (finds)
-load roles from db and store them in cache on app boot. flush cache at role create/update
-set default title in main layout (low priority).
-clean main layout of bloats, keywords, tags, descriptions etc.
-add constant for gender somewhere, preferrebaly all the constants in a single file.
-add href links on whatsapp and phone
- setup ajax for everything in admin panel. Make some universal template/partial/solution to make code less redundant and easily managable.
-(superadmin)add an option to make a clinic inactive, also need to add status column in migration.
- fetch admin's details on view clinic page on superadmin panel (use model relationships)
- while deleting a lot from js ajax we need to send the post request to the sub domain route instead of the old route.
    -solution: store the prefix route somewhere so that it can be accessed globally.(think about this,
    this technique will be used in all the ajax call in future)
-check the animation and css of see all clinics button on index page.
-on main index page, select2 is disabled for now because it's css is clashing with other css and breaking the ui.
-see all doctors button have wrong vertical spacing on doctors caraousel.


#App's index page

    -Search Section
        -load more //later when doing ajax and js

    -3rd Speciality section
        -when clicked on see all, send to search page and display results. //later (search page)
        -when clicked on single Speciality send to search page with results. //later (search page)
        -need to make a search page with partials that can display both clinics and doctors with see all. (search page)
    -Book our best clinic
        -need to create a section where doctors for respective clinic can be shown. //later (search page)
    -Navbar
            -Apply links on menus. //later
            -make a button for doctor/clinic registration right beside the login/signup(maybe later) //later
    -2nd section
            -keep it like this only. ask later for changes or links etc.


-think about the search page and filters. can clinic and doctor search be combined?
    -make the filter/search page and also include the filter/search parameters.

-book appointment overlay is not covering the navbar. fix it.
-timeslot is a function of doctor, not user. fix that everywhere. (update: user is doctor because of role column, all doctors are users but all users are not doctors)

-layouts and partials are not getting included in register and login page. fix that.

####checking flow/routewise. reviewing code while organizing them.
- if timeslot is booked, don't show it.
-fix register/login pages. include layout and partials.

-start with clinic admin backend and check everything

-appointment details should be create or update instead of just create.
-add press enter to upate medicine. this feature is working while adding the medicine.
    -refactor jquery code for medicines.
    -make a universal jquery library for ajax,

-delete medicatins funciton.
- apointment details should be insert or update instead of just insert.

-global auth and middleware is working, setup to all the users.

#### Super Admin ####

#Things left
    -Profile settings not working
    -Specialities and services featue is not implementd
    -Quick view option is not setup on recent clinics widget on dashboard.

#### Admin ####

-on guest doctor profile send data using sessions or something else. do not use get in a href. and use validation for qualificaion,speciality and other nullable columns.

app logo, name, etc should come from a single place throughout the whole app.
check why clinicSlug is a compulsory parameter in some functions.


#### flow ###

-on appointment details page new medicine's row is fetched from the page's Dom itself. save it in a js variable and render that on add new click button.
-currently if the medicine row is left blank an integrity constraint error for not nullable column is thrown. if the row is deleted, it works fine.
-in medicine section when a medicine is added then the edit action button doesn't work because the whole section is rendered dynamically via js, fix that.

-fix view clinic page on guest (when testing guest/patient).

-medicine's list datable is not loading medicine name automatically when updating the medicine second time.

#######naveen sir's changes####
patient's account can add multiple pateint's on their own account. (max 5)
 od bd tds,sos (doctor's medicine)
sos medicine (take when required)
make medicine ui seamless (after meal)
follow up mein calendar lagao which shows sundays marked with red.
doctor's perscription has a qr that sends to website. (show text login to see medical details/history etc.)
#bug
    patients can book apointment twice if pressed back

medicine delete feature is not available.

put common partials, layouts, views, and controllers in a single global place. (use gates and policies to restrict access)

admin can not edit patient type user because patients are getting saved in a different table than user(just a theory, check it.).

add necessary columns in patients migration also update the patient edit in doctor's panel .

while storing medicines. compositions can also be stored. it's options.
    -can be seached using composition.
        for eg paracetamol gives the result zenflox, dolo etc.
        composition should be dropdown, it makes the tasks easier.

#refractor
-make time slot card partial and use it in admin and doctor's panel

- while fetching appointments for patient on using appointment service, there should be other relationships such as doctors and cliinics etc. fix that.

-Connect controllers with their respective services as you go.
- make add medicine ui good then implement it in doctor's panel.


####current task ####


since clinic's admin is a user now. we can call a partial to create admin since it needs basic user details only. call this partial everhwhere else.
    -for now, only storing name, phone and password. once the parital is made can also include the same on the clinic's creation page.
    -need to take care of validation. user's validation will be applied, instead of calling createClinicAdmin, can simple call create use inside.


###start from here ###


fix all the authentication. since the db structure is changed now, see if same auth can be used for all the users.
make the auth and middlewares universal so this can be used for multiple user type.

##flow

########################

#### Error Handling ####
    #how to do this
        -Make the whole project, make Contrller s and proper service classes. Throw errors anyway you want and handle anyway you want. just make sure youre handling errors properly and there're no security concerns or bugs.
        -When the project is done a pattern will emerge for erros.
        -Simple make heloper functions that are global and call then when needed. keep everythign in these functions and abstract everything. makes the clean more readable and maintainable.

#### Ajax JQuery ####
    -Follow same method as error handling

########################

##Super admin##
-Everything works perfectly.
-Only Low priority tasks are left.

-make view/update admin on super admin view clinic page (low priority)
    -Can add more fields while adding clinic admin.(low priority)
    -show admins of a clinic in table (since there can be multiple admins now).

- states, city, specialities can use seeder for input, skipping the cruds for these. (very low priotiry)
    - states, city, specialities can use medicine masters layout partials, logic etc. write once used many.

#start from here
user is getting created on admin panel. including doctors.

    -proper try catch block and error throwing with edge cases.
    -check proper errors.
    -use x alert
        -remove default error if x alert is used.
    -use universal messages (think and research)
        - make reusable function if possible
    -throw error from service clases and catch in the controller. There's no need to create new error messages
    in controller, makes the code redundant.


### Extra ###
    -Review clinic slug manager middleware. it might cause problems when the clinic session is not set. think again and fix any edge cases that are found.


** need to create a role checking middleware or helper function and it'll run automatically before doing a task that needs roles and permissions.

**user module is complete.
    -Send proper errors from service class.
    -Use x-alert


need to make the height of the uploaded images(profile pics and logos) universal/standard so that it doesn't breaks ui.

-if slot is filled, it should not show on the backend.


#apointment
-patient history etc.

### observation ###
use inbuilt modals, the one that comes when deleting the time slots. they're sick.
remove delete all button on time slot page.
create my profile page (user can manage their own profile)
on doctor's profile if whatsapp, email etc not available show N/a or -.
    do this on clinics page too and everwhere else needed.
after patient books appointment view appointment button not working.
    also can make ui of this page better.
patients should be able to go to the dashboard from landing page's navbar
in appointment controller's store method check weather auth is necessary once if a middleware is protecting this route already.

-Review scope of ajax jquery, can it be standard and global without any major changes.
-think about highlighting the failed validation fields using jquery too.


let's build an ajax jquery library


#play with new docuure template


can create global base panel templates too. just pass the auth user and everything works. need to take care of just sidebar partial.


##############
adding family members on patents.
    -update family member (done)
    -relation name is coming from a config file. need a way to render this content. (fix)
# create and update ajax is working fine. next step is to refactor the code and make small functions to make it more global.


-fix the images size problem for profile pictures. (bug)

- might need to change the add patient on doctor's panel (might need to add dependant there with primary contact information)

#Finish everything related to appointments by 12/03
    -that includes selecting dependants while making walkin appointments. (done)
    -Check thoroughly that everything is presentable and working (meeting with Naveen sir on 13/03)

#next
-check the app and look for problems in process/flow.


#############
#clinic admin
-convert add time slots on admin panel to ajax.
-add medicines (will get fixed with adding city, states etc)
-swal on medicine edit.

#doctor
-save appointment page, swal on save. ajax
    need to handle all the erorrs and edge cases. turning off for now.

#check the flow, frontend(app landing), doctor's page, clinic's page.

- if logged in disable the contact person's information while booking new clinic.
-check prescription for right details.
    for eg. age is wrong on the pdf (mistake happening in calculation).
