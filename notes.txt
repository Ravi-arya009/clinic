-see and set roles during login
-protect routes, apply gaurds

###admin
-login
-match roles and then send to dashboard.

-to do (finds)
-load roles from db and store them in cache on app boot. flush cache at role create/update
create_users.blade.php
    make role dropdown dynamic so newly added roles can be fetched automatically
make roles dynamic in authcontroller in store() function while validating
-user_list.blade.php role column is using role array from config. this might cause process overload. look into this.
-role is not working for /admin/dashboard somehow, check it.
-set default title in main layout (low priority).
-clean main layout of bloats, keywords, tags, descriptions etc.
-add profile picture column in db
-remove bloats from user card in admin's user list page.
-filter by not working on admin's user list page.
-load only 9 users and then add load more functionality.
-add constant for gender somewhere, preferrebaly all the constants in a single file.
-add dob column
-add href links on whatsapp and phone
- make create user, view/edit user with same partials. so that errors and success messages can be displayed at the same page.
- remove bloats such as scripts and stylesheets from footer and header. push only needed ones to the views. saves load time.
- add appointment fees somewhere.
- setup ajax for everything in admin panel. Make some universal template/partial/solution to make code less redundant and easily managable.
- change classes name for different pages. for instance, appointment list template is used in clinic list. everywhere the css classes are
according to appointments. change them to clinics otherwise it'll cause confusion in future.
-(superadmin)add an option to make a clinic inactive, also need to add status column in migration.
- need to setup pagination or load more option where required. write once use many
- fetch admin's details on view clinic page on superadmin panel (use model relationships)
- while deleting a lot from js ajax we need to send the post request to the sub domain route instead of the old route.
    -solution: store the prefix route somewhere so that it can be accessed globally.(think about this,
    this technique will be used in all the ajax call in future)
-check the animation and css of see all clinics button on index page.
-on main index page, select2 is disabled for now because it's css is clashing with other css and breaking the ui.
- use datatables where can be instead of panel's list ui. datatables inbuilt searching and sorting.
make sure to use ajax for searching, filters etc to fetch data from the backend asynchronously.

#current task
    #patient
        -add clinic logo in db and view.
        -next available

        -add map location on clinic and then patients can know how much farther the clinic is from their location.(extra feature)
